Adaptations to NanoHTTPD for easier subclassing.  NanoHTTPD is a simple HTTP server written in Java that's suitable for Android apps.

NanoHTTPDPooled provides a simple HTTP connection pool per the recommendation at http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Networking/Webserver/.  The intent is to offload the overhead involved in thread management from time-of-request to time-of-instantiation.

The absence of a package name is intentional.  This is DIY code, and the license allows you to adopt you own package name to the source.

To use:
* Add the source files to your project.  Use either NanoHTTPD, NanoHTTPPooled, or AndroidHTTPD.
* If using AndroidHTTPD:
** Instantiate NanoHTTPD from your Activity or Service as desired.
** Threading handled internally.
** Override onRequestReceived(...) with your handler code.  Or, set an application-visible folder as wwwroot.
* See http://elonen.iki.fi/code/nanohttpd/#ways-to-use for context.
